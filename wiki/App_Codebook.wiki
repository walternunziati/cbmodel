#summary use the CbModel library for the local videos .

= Overview =
This sketch uses the library CbModel for *local video*, it allows you to view the video test and the results obtained from CbModel on the video test. This application also allows you to set the parameters for the library at *run-time*

== What I need to run App_Codebook sketch? ==
App_Codebook  is a sketch  for <a href="http://processing.org/">Processing</a>,use the <a href="http://users.design.ucla.edu/~acolubri/processing/gsvideo/home/advanced.html">GSMovie</a> library to extract frames from video

== How to use ==
Launched Sketch, is a fairly intuitive form, the lower are the *InputBox* to set the parameters:
(if not included are set by default)
    * alpha - brightness'parameter ,between 0.2-0.7 ( 
    * beta - brightness'parameter,tipically between 1.1-1.8 
    * percent_tm - temporal threshold's parameter,tipically is 0.7
    * epsilon_1 - max tollerance of brightenns's deviation and the color of a pixel(in    order too recognise a pixel from another) phase's "Learning"
    * frames - number of frames to create the model
    * epsilon_2 - max tollerance of brightenns's deviation and the color of a pixel(in order too recognise a pixel from another) phase's "Testing"(you can change at runtime)
(mandatory parameter)
    * video - path the local video (must be set last)
  
After the initialization parameters necessary fields to the library just click on run (green arrow). A runt-time you can set a parameter (denoted with '*')
