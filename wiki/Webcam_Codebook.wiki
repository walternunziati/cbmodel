#summary use the CbModel library for video stream of the webcam

= Overview =
This sketch uses the library CbModel for *video stream of the webcam*, it allows you to view the video test and the results obtained from CbModel on the video test<br>This application also allows you to set the parameters for the library at *run-time*

== What I need to run Webcam_Codebook sketch? ==
Webcam_Codebook  is a sketch  for <a href="http://processing.org/">Processing</a>
<br>You need a separate program to take the stream from the webcam and save it as an image
== How to use ==
Launched Sketch, is a fairly intuitive form, the lower are the *inputBox* to set the parameters:<br>
(if not included are set by default)
    * alpha - brightness'parameter ,between 0.4-0.7  
    * beta - brightness'parameter,tipically between 1.1-1.5 
    * percent_tm - temporal threshold's parameter,tipically is 0.5
    * epsilon_1 - max tollerance of brightenns's deviation and the color of a pixel(in    order too recognise a pixel from another) phase's "Learning"
    * frames - number of frames to create the model
    * epsilon_2 - max tollerance of brightenns's deviation and the color of a pixel(in order too recognise a pixel from another) phase's "Testing"(you can *change at runtime*)
(mandatory parameter)
    * video - image product by webcam(the video *must be in the subfolder "video"* in the sketch)
  
After the initialization parameters necessary fields to the library just click on run (green arrow).<br>
	
Initially being in the process of "learning" is only shown the video and each frame is passed to CbModel to create the model.<br>
Recently the number of frames to create the model (parameter frames), the library passes in the "Testing" and the sketch shows both the webcam video (left) and <br>difference images created by CbModel (on right)

== Installation ==
=== STEP ONE: Unpack CbModel ===
Extract the compressed file in a part of the system and copy it in the folder libraries of your Processing sketchbook

=== Step TWO: Using the library ===
After starting <a href="http://processing.org/">Processing</a>, go to menu File-> Sketchbook->Webcam_Codebook
